ECG-Based Anomaly Detection & Health Monitoring System
          This project implements a real-time ECG anomaly detection system using deep learning (Transformer model), 
IoT sensors (AD8232, MAX30102), and an integrated user interface powered by Streamlit, Telegram Bot, and voice assistant.
It leverages Firebase for real-time data sync and supports remote access via a responsive frontend and chatbot.
